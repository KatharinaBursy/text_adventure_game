# Text Adventure Game 

I have developed a gamen based on the movie Indiana Jones, as well as an egyptian mythology book that I am currently reading. It does not strictly follow the movie's storyline since I enhanced it with my ideas.
The game consists of three stages, and features defined functions for start, win, and lose and user inputs based on whcih the player advances in the game. 
Play now to discover the temple that is full of surprises and see if you make it out alive!
